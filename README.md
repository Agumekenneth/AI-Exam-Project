# AI-Exam-Project
Road Traffic Accidents remain a serious challenge in many developing countries. Several factors, including driver behavior, road conditions, weather, and vehicle type, contribute to accident outcomes. This project applies a Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN) to predict the severity of road accidents using a dataset from Ethiopia.
